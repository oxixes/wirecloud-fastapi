WireCloud builds on cutting-edge end-user development, RIA and semantic
technologies to offer a next-generation end-user centred web application mashup
platform aimed at leveraging the long tail of the Internet of Services.

WireCloud builds on cutting-edge end-user (software) development, RIA and
semantic technologies to offer a next-generation end-user centred web
application mashup platform aimed at allowing end users without programming
skills to easily create web applications and dashboards/cockpits (e.g. to
visualize their data of interest or to control their domotized home or
environment). Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, application
logic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherent
and value-adding composite applications. They are targeted at leveraging the
"long tail" of the Web of Services (a.k.a. the Programmable Web) by exploiting
rapid development, DIY, and shareability. They typically serve a specific
situational (i.e. immediate, short-lived, customized) need, frequently with high
potential for reuse. Is this "situational" character which precludes them to be
offered as 'off-the-shelf' functionality by solution providers, and therefore
creates the need for a tool like WireCloud.

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information

[Context Processing, Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/processing).\
