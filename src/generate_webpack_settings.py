"""
Generate a small settings JSON for webpack in the system temporary directory.
The output path is taken from the WEBPACK_SETTINGS_JSON environment variable if set,
otherwise the script writes to: <tempdir>/wirecloud_settings_js.json.

The produced JSON contains only one key for now: `installedApps`, which is a list
of objects: { "name": "catalogue", "module": "wirecloud.catalogue", "path": "/abs/path/to/module" }
